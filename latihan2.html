            <h1>About US</h1>
            <p>Indonesia, with relatively high levels of poverty and unemployment, faces major challenges, especially in facing economic and social competition at the world level.
                One of the main strategy in overcoming poverty is by empowering people's skills and knowledge to prepare them in entering highly competitive jobs.
                However, the main obstacle faced by most people, especially those who live in villages, is the lack of opportunities and facilities to increase their education level.
                Driven by the passion for knowledge sharing and contributing to empower the Indonesian education, a number of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) practitioners agreed to form a foundation called the International Yayasan Onno Center Internasional (Onno Center International Foundation). Similar to Onno W. Purbo's expetice, the Onno Center International Foundation focuses on ICT education.
                As the name suggests, the foundation was formed as an appreciation to Indonesian Internet Samuray, Onno W. Purbo, who has long dreamed and fought on the ground to make changes in the Indonesian society.
                He believes that Indonesia can be move forward towards advanced society, along side the education level of the people. In short, he dreams to see the dawn of Indonesian knowledge based society over Indonesian Internet.
